# Horndeski functions #
#######################

# See documentation for meaning of these functions
# The Horndeski functions should be defined in terms of phi, X (see functional dependence
# of the Horndeski functions in the reduced Horndeski action) and
# and real-valued constants. Any constants must be defined in the theory symbols
# that follows.

K = k_1*X + k_2*X*X


G3 = g_31*X + g_32*X*X

##################
# Theory symbols #
##################
# Here you declare the symbols needed to construct your specific theory.
# Typically this involves giving names to the constants in the model.

#Syntax: left side is the variable name that python will call it by, right is a
# string that indicates how the symbol should be displayed (use LaTeX notation)
# the variable name (key) MUST end in "_symbol" (without quotation marks)
# The order in which these are written matter! The following section must have
# parameter values ordered in the same way as you choose to do for the symbols 
# here.

k2_symbol =  "k_2"

###############################
# Horndeski Parameter values  #
###############################
# Set values for the parameters, i.e. constants, introduced in your Horndeski function definitions.
# The key for these parameters must end in _parameter
# The order in which they are defined matter! The order must match the 
# symbolic names for these parameters above
# One of these may be ignored if you choose to apply the closure constraint on
# a model parameter. You must still set dummy values for this parameter though.

#if True, the min, max and number arguments below this section are ignored.
#if False, the path is ignored instead.

# Closure declaration #
#######################
# Here you decide which variable is solved for via the Friedmann-like closure equation

# for via closure

# This sets the initial guess for the variable that will be numerically solved for through

# or as a parameter value will be ignored and the guess_value, and then the result of solving
# the closure equation will be used instead.
