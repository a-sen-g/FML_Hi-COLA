# Hi-COLA

*We cannot recommend that anyone uses Hi-COLA in its current, very messy state. We are in the process of cleaning up the code and adding documentation, such that the code will soon be much easier to understand and use, at which point we will release and advertise it publicly.*

Hi-COLA (Horndeski in COLA) is a code that allows COLA simulations to be run in Horndeski gravity.

Hi-COLA is based on the COLASolver contained within the [FML library](https://github.com/HAWinther/FML). For documentation and more info about the original FML library see the [website](https://fml.wintherscoming.no/). See also the [Doxygen documentation](https://fml.wintherscoming.no/doxygen/).
